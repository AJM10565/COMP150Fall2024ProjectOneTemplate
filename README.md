# Prototype of Project

## Description
This is a Pokemon-style combat game that involves a quest that the player must complete to save halloween night. The game is set on Halloween Night in Salem, Massachusetts. 
The player will be able to choose between a vampire, a werewolf, and a witch. There will be challenges that allow the player to lose or gain health.
There will be random events and opportunities to regain or lose health based on your luck.
### The Night of the Game
Our goal is to make the setting and vibe very eerie and off-putting. It will almost be like the beginning of a horror movie when something is aloof, but no one knows why. For the challenges in the game, there will be obstacles to slow the player down. We are thinking of adding monsters and other creatures that the player will have to fight off. The character has three strikes, and when they use up the third strike, the game resets, and the player is back to where they spawned to restart the game. 

### The goal of the game is to complete the quest successfully and make it through alive. It will be like any other action driven video game where the player must fight, block, run, dodge (and so on) their way through the landscape.
